**Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Lesion Classification (HAM10000 Dataset)**

**Project Summary:**
This project tackles the challenge of skin cancer lesion classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It leverages the extensive HAM10000 dataset, which contains labeled images of various skin lesions. By learning patterns within these images, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of skin cancer. It's crucial to emphasize that this project serves educational and research purposes and is not a substitute for a qualified healthcare professional's diagnosis.

**Technical Approach:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
CNNs are particularly adept at extracting features from images, making them ideal for tasks like image classification.
In this project, the CNN component focuses on identifying relevant visual patterns within the skin lesion images.
Data and Processing:

**HAM10000 Dataset:**
This project utilizes the HAM10000 dataset, a valuable resource for skin lesion analysis.
It comprises a vast collection of images showcasing various skin lesions along with corresponding labels indicating their specific types.

**Preprocessing:**
To ensure optimal training, the images in the dataset undergo preprocessing steps like resizing and normalization.
This helps create a consistent format for the model to effectively learn from the data.
Model Training and Usage:

**Training:**
The CNN model is meticulously trained using the preprocessed HAM10000 dataset.
During training, the model iteratively learns to recognize the distinct features associated with different skin cancer types present in the images.

**Classification:**
Once trained, the model can be used to classify new, unseen skin lesion images.
By analyzing the features extracted by the CNN, the model aims to predict the most likely cancer category for the given image.

**Project Goals:**
Advance the exploration of CNNs for skin cancer lesion classification.
Contribute to the development of automated systems that can potentially aid in early skin cancer detection.
